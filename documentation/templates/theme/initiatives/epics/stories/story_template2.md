As a powerlifter, I want to be able to customize my dashboard, so that I can easily see the lifting data that's most important to me.

By following this template, you can create user stories that are structured and easy to understand. To make the user story even more effective, you can add acceptance criteria that specify the requirements that must be met to consider the user story complete. Here's an example of a user story with acceptance criteria:

Acceptance Criteria: Users can select and add widgets to the dashboard to display their lifting data, including lifting numbers, progress charts, and personal records. Users can save their customized dashboard and have it persist across sessions. Users can reset their dashboard to the default layout at any time.
